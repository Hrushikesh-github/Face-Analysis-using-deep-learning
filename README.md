# Face-Analysis-using-deep-learning
Using FER and Adience datasets, set of deep learning models which provide emotions, age and gender properties of all the faces in a image or video

Models trained on Adience dataset and FER2013 dataset utilized for gender, age and emotion recognition

Trained my custom model on Adience dataset which achieved 20% greater rank-1 accuracy in the age category
compared to the corresponding publication of dataset.

Trained a model on FER dataset achieving 66.07% accuracy which is equivalent to 5 position in the leadership board
of the former competition.
